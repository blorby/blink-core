# blink-core
The blink-core plugin provides access to commonly used CLIs and other actions.

---
**Currently, the following integrations and actions are supported:**

## AWS CLI
The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

## Azure CLI
The Azure command-line interface (Azure CLI) is a set of commands used to create and manage Azure resources. The Azure CLI is available across Azure services and is designed to get you working quickly with Azure. The Azure CLI is optimized for managing and administering Azure resources from the command line, and for building automation scripts that work with ARM (the Azure Resource Manager) and other tools.

## Bash
Bash is a Unix shell and command language written by Brian Fox for the GNU Project. Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script.

## Amazon EKS CLI - eksctl
`eksctl` is a simple command line utility for creating and managing clusters on EKS - Amazon's managed Kubernetes service for EC2.

## Email
The email action allows the user to send emails through Blink.

## Fetch File
The fetch file action allows the user to fetch a file from the web.

## GCloud CLI
The  `gcloud`  command-line tool is the primary CLI tool to create and manage Google Cloud resources. You can use this tool to perform many common platform tasks either from the command line or in scripts and other automations.

For example, you can use the  `gcloud`  tool to create and manage:
-   Compute Engine virtual machine instances and other resources
-   Cloud SQL instances
-   Google Kubernetes Engine clusters
-   Dataproc clusters and jobs
-   Cloud DNS managed zones and record sets
-   Cloud Deployment Manager deployments

You can also use the  `gcloud`  tool to deploy App Engine applications, manage authentication, customize local configuration, and perform other tasks.

## Git CLI
Git CLI is a command-line tool that brings pull requests, issues, git actions, and other git features to your terminal, so you can do all your work in one place.

## JP
`jp` is a command line tool that reformats JSON to make it easier to read. It only adds and removes whitespace, which means that your data wonâ€™t get silently altered.

## JQ
`jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. You can use it to slice, filter, map and transform structured data.

## Kubernetes CLI - kubectl
The Kubernetes command-line tool, `kubectl`, allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. You can use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.

## NodeJS
The NodeJS action executes user-provided JS code.

## Python
The Python action executes user-provided Python code.

## TerraForm CLI
The Terraform Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to manage infrastructure, and interact with Terraform state, providers, configuration files, and Terraform Cloud.

## Vault CLI
The Vault Command Line Interface (CLI) wraps common Vault functionality and formats output. The Vault CLI is a single static binary. It is a thin wrapper around the HTTP API. Every CLI command maps directly to the HTTP API internally.
